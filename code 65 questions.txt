1. Write a function which takes as input a string (from the user) that consists only of the digits from 0 to 9 and 
   outputs a distribution showing how many times each digit appears in the string. 
    
   "01223334444566" - should produce the following output:
	0: 1
	1: 1
	2: 2
	3: 3
	4: 4
	5: 1
	6: 2
	7: 0	
	8: 0
	9: 0

2. Create a Class that will accept the relevant parameters (into functions) to calculate the area of the following shapes:
   - Rectangle, Square, Circle. 
   The main program will request using a menu of options, which 'area' the user wishes to calculate, after which will request
   the values needed and then proceed to display the area of the shape chosen. 

3. Create a program to read in a decimal value and output the binary and hexadecimal equivalent values of the input. 

4. A program is needed that will calculate and display the amount payable and the kilometres per litre when a customer is filling
   their petrol tank at a garage. The amount payable is calculated by multiplying the amount of litres needed to fill the tank by
   the price per litre. The kilometres per litre are calculated by dividing the kilometres driven by the amount of litres needed 
   to fill the tank. The amount of litres needed to fill the tank, the price per litre and the amount of kilometres driven since 
   the last filling are to be entered by an operator. Define the problem by constructing an :-
	Hierarchy Chart (making use of methods/modules)		
	Input Processing Output Chart	
	Flowchart			
 	Complete the pseudocode and the java program as well 

5. Draw a flowchart, code the pseudo code & the java program for the following problem: 
   Mr. Brown has given 3 tests to his class of 50 students. He would like to have the average mark of the 3 tests for each student, 
   a class average, and the highest and lowest average of the 3 tests. Develop a solution to calculate and display out these values. 
   In your processing he would also like you to display the symbol achieved(next to the student number and the average of the 3 tests) 
   by each student. Symbol allocation is as follows: 
	75 – 100 	= A
	70 – 74   	= B
 	60 – 69   	= C
	50 – 59   	= D
	Below 50 	= F

6. The Salary department of ThisClothing Co. would like their employee’s new salaries (with a tax deduction) printed out in a formal 
   report and thereby eliminating the human error factor. Unfortunately the company lost count of the number of employees in their company. 

   Design a flowchart (and pseudo code and a java program (in the Java program use JOptionPane)) that will prompt an operator for an 
   employee’s number, their name and age (Use the “#” character to stop the processing of the employees). Your program must then 
   calculate the salary with the necessary tax deduction and display it to the screen. The Basic salary for all employees is R3500.00. 

   A tax deduction needs to be calculated and subtracted from the basic salary. The percentage of the tax deduction is allocated according 
   to their age. Here are the percentages of tax deductions allocated for the various age groups. 
	Age		Percentage
	<= 18		0%
	19 - 24		5%
	25 - 30		10%
	31 - 35		15%
	>= 36		20%

   You are to display the Employee's Name, their Age, the Basic Salary, the Tax Deduction and the New Salary to the screen. 
   After you have calculated the list of employee’s the company would like to know 
	- The number of employees you have calculated salaries for, 
	- The total salaries payable to all the employees and,
	- The total tax payable.

7. DO NOT CODE THE JAVA PROGRAM FOR THIS QUESTION - ONLY THE PSEUDO CODE AND THE FLOWCHART
	Given an integer array (numArr) that contains 20 elements, write an algorithm to solve the following problem:
	•	Read values into the array
	•	Insertion sort the array into descending order
	•	Bubble sort the array into ascending order
	•	Print the sorted array
	•	Add together all the numbers that are < 10
	•	Print out the sum of the numbers < 10, and the average with an appropriate message.

8. Draw a flowchart, code the pseudo code & the java program for the following problem: 
   The Municipality needs to bill residents of their city for the use of water and electricity. A structure has been set up 
   whereby residents that are large consumers of water and electricity are charged at a higher rate than those that use a 
   minimal amount. There is also a discount for Senior citizens. The Usage is being measured in kilo-litres. 
 
	The rates are as follows:
	Usage				Charge
	0 – 250 litres			R0-00 / litre		
	251 – 500 litres		R10-00 / litre
	501- 2000 litres		R25-00 / litre	
	2001 and above			R30-00 / litre
 
   Your input will be: 
   The person’s account number, 
   Whether the person is a senior citizen or not (Resident, with the value of “S” for senior citizen or “N” for normal citizen) and 
   Their monthly water and electricity consumption. 

   If the resident is a senior citizen then a discount of 5% is deducted from their TOTAL AMOUNT owing.

   You need to output 
   The Account Number, 
   Whether the person is a Senior citizen or a Normal citizen.
   VAT - charged on the amount charged, at 14%.
   The water and electricity consumption and the amount owing to the municipality.	

9. Draw a flowchart, code the pseudo code & the java program for the following problem:  
   A lecturer on campus would like a program that calculates the average mark his class has achieved for a specific test. 
   Along with the average mark he would also like to know which student got the highest mark in the class and which student got 
   the lowest mark in the class. Besides calculating the average, highest and lowest, he wants to show his students what grades 
   they achieved. 

   The most important thing is that he wants the program to work for any size class, so you must use a sentinel value of 999 
   for the test mark, to stop the processing of the loop.

   You are required to enter the following details:
   Student Number, Student Name, Test Mark 

   From the above values you are required to calculate and output:
   	1. Each Student’s name and number with the grade they achieved
		This grade is decided as follows:
			mark		grade
			75 – 100	A
			70 – 74		B
			60 – 69		C
			50 – 59		D
			40 - 49		E
			< 40 		F
	2. The average mark for the test.
	3. The Highest Mark with the Students’ Name and Student Number.
	4. The Lowest Mark with the Students’ Name and Student Number.
	5. How many students are in the class.
*Use JOptionPane to read in all relevant values, and display all the values using System.out.print/ln

10. Write an algorithm for the following problem in negative logic:
    You are required to read in the sales and output the commission. 

	The commission is based on the sales as follows:
	Sales					Commission
	Less than R15 000			5% of sales
	R15 001 - R30 000			8% of sales
	R30 001 - R40 000			10% of sales
	More than R40 000			15% of sales

11. Oom Piet van Donnor sells second-hands cars (obviously you could find fifth-hands too) at a very reasonable price,
    at least that what he says. His motto is: I DON’T SELL CHEAP CARS; I SELL CARS CHEAP. 

    There is extra amount paid depending on the colour and sound system (with no radio or with radio) on a car. All red and 
    black cars have an additional 5% on their original price and the radio adds an extra R450.

    There is also a discount based on the deposit paid follows:
	Deposit 					Discount
	Less than R10 000				R300
	R1 000.01 to R15 000				5% of original price
	R15 000.01 to R25 000				R500 + 2% of every R200 above R15000
	Above R25 000					15% of original price

    He has asked you the best TWR programmer to write a program that reads the following:
	Original price of a car
	Amount paid 	
	Vehicle colour  
	Sound system, yes or no 

	Your program must calculate:
	1.	The radio price if any.
	2.	The colour price if any.
	3.	The new price, after taking into consideration the above prices and the original price, this must also be output.
	4.	Calculate the discount.
	5.	Total disc given to all customers, this must also be output.
	6.	Remaining balance for each customer, this must also be output.
	7.	Number of customers served; this must also be output.

    The numbers of customers is unknown and hence use a sentinel value of –111 on a deposit to end your program.
