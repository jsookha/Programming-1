Please note that for the following question, you are required to use procedures or functions 
in your program. 

----------------------------
1. Mr. Jones always gives True/False tests to his class. His tests always have 10 questions.
The maximum class size is 15. He needs a program that will calculate and output
each student’s number, their total score/percentage for a test and their grade. You are 
also required to output the lowest and highest mark/percentage along with the student number 
associated to those marks

Develop a solution for Mr. Jones’s problem. The following 1-dimensional arrays are needed 

Variable 		Description						Size 
strStudentNum		to store the student numbers 				15
intTestMark		to store the total mark for a test for a student	15
strGrade		to store the grade equivalent to the mark received 	15 

strTestAns		to store the correct answers for the test		10 

When inputting the student's details, you are required to input each student's set of 
answers for the 10 questions in the test. Using the strTestAns array, you need to compare 
the input to the answers stated in the array. Accumulate the total mark of all correct answers
and store this mark in the intTestMark array. 

Store the following values for the strTestAns array, to be used for the comparison to the 
student's set of answers  
Question	Answer 
1 		true
2		true
3		false
4 		true
5		false
6		true
7		false
8		false
9		true
10		false 

Using the intTestMark (total mark), store the student's grade using the following information 

Percentage		Grade
80 - 100		A
70 - 79			B
60 - 69			C
50 - 59			D
< 50 			F

	
2. a. The student names and the grades for four tests for Mr. Smith’s class have been
placed in parallel arrays. Mr. Smith would like to have one student’s name and
test scores printed. Develop a solution that will enter the student’s name, search
for the name in the same array, and then print the name and test scores. Use the
sequential-search method.

b. Modify the solution in problem 2a to use a binary search instead of a sequential
search.

3. John has a weather station in his house. He has been keeping track of the fastest
wind speed for each day for two weeks. He would like to know the average wind
speed over the two weeks, the days on which the highest wind speed and the lowest
wind speed were recorded, and the difference between the highest wind speed
recorded and each day’s average wind speed.

4. Create a solution to print the number of times a pair of dice would be rolled before
there would be a duplicate number. (Hint: Store the values of each roll in an array (size 50)
and check the values of the array each time the dice are rolled.)

5. Expand problem 4 to print the average number of rolls over N times. N is an input
value.
