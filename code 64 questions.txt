1. Read in a word (or phrase) and determine if its a palindrome. 
(I have not taught you how to manipulate strings, but it would be interesting for you to figure out how to do this)

2. Calculate the mass of air in a car tyre, using the formula
	PV = 0.37,(T + 460)
	P = pressure, pounds per inch
	V = volume, cubic feet
	m = mass of air, pounds
	T = temperature, degrees Fahrenheit
The tyre contains 2 cubic feet of air. Assume that the pressure is 32 pounds per square inch at room temperature. 

3. Calculate the sum of the first n odd integers. Test the program by calculating the first 100 odd integers. 

4. Write a program to read into two 1D Arrays (sized 10), the student numbers (4 digits long) and the full name 
of the student. Request from the user if they wish to sort the sort the class list by student number or by name
and proceed to use the Bubble-Sort method to sort the class list. Using another method, print the class list after 
the data has been sorted. Please make sure to pass the 2 arrays as arguments to the print method. After the sort, 
request once again from the user if they wish to sort. Kepp on asking until the user chooses to end the program.
