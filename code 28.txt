/*
 * Program: Using a loop - but abruptly kicking you out of the loop
 * Date: 25/3/2019
 * Programmer: J.Sookha
 * Description: when inside a for loop - it must run its full term before executing 
 *		any other instructions outside the loop 
 *		to stop the loop would mean to give the counter a value outside of the 
 *		condition that is tested
