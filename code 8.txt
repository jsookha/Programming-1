 * Question: 
	An employee came in to work and clocked in at MorningIn, clocked out at
	NoonOut for lunch, clocked back in at NoonIn, and clocked out to go home at	
	NightOut (all in minutes since midnight). Set up equations to calculate the number
	of hours and the number of minutes the employee worked for the day. (You will
	develop two equations.)
