Questions 

1. The Fantastic Floral Company sells to wholesale and retail buyers. The wholesale
buyer needs a resale number in order to buy at no tax and to receive discounts. The retail
buyer pays 6% tax. These are the discounts to the wholesale buyer:

	Amount < R100			Discount = 2% 
	Amount >= R100 AND < R500	Discount = 5%
	Amount >= R500			Discount = 10%

Given an amount of purchase, how much will the customer owe the company?

2. Calculate the water bill given the cubic feet of water used for Eureka Water Company, 
which charges the homeowner one of the following:

3. An admission charge for The City Theater varies according to the age of the person. 
Develop a solution to print the ticket charge given the age of the person.
The charges are as follows:
a. Over 55: R10.00
b. 21–54: R15.00
c. 13–20: R10.00
d. 3–12: R5.00

4. A customer needs a specific amount of paper. The charges on the paper are R0.10 for
single sheets, R0.055 for amounts in multiples of 100 sheets, R0.04 in multiples of
500 sheets, and R0.03 in multiples of 1000 sheets. 

Develop a solution to calculate the type and number of package(s) for the least amount 
of money the customer should buy, given the minimum amount of sheets the customer needs. 

(For example, if the customer needs 380 sheets, the amount she would pay when buying in 
multiples of 100 would be R22.00. However, if the customer bought 500 sheets, the cost 
would be R20.00. It would be cost effective for the customer to buy a package of 500 sheets.)

5. A hotel has a pricing policy as follows:
a. 2 people: R85
b. 3 people: R90
c. 4 people: R95

If the customer is staying on company business, there is a 20% discount. If the customer
is over 60 years of age, there is a 15% discount. A customer does not receive both discounts. 
Given the above data, print the cost of the room.
