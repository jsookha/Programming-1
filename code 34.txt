/*
 * Program: Using 1 Dimensional Arrays again 
 * Date: 3/4/2019
 * Programmer: J.Sookha
 * Description: Took the question from code 27 - about displaying the discounted price for 5 days
 * 		given the original price from the user - this time however - we are saving the 
 *		prices in an array so that the printing can happen elsewhere
